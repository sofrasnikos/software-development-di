Q objectives readmission has a major role in the reduction of the quality of life and the increase in the years of lost life the main objectives of this study were to answer to the following research questions a what was the readmission rate b what were the social demographic and clinical characteristics of patients admitted to the psychiatric emergency service at nour university hospital affiliated to isfahan university of medical sciences isfahan iran c what were the effective factors on readmission method this cross sectional study was conducted on a total number of 3935 patients who were admitted to isfahan university hospital psychiatric ward in isfahan iran from 2004 to 2010 gender age marital status education self report history of previous admission type of psychiatric disorder substance misuse suicide and the length of the current psychiatric disorder were collected from the registered medical files of patients the data were analysed using the negative binomial regression model results we found that factors such as psychiatric anxiety disorder bipolar i bipolar ii psychotic disorder depression and self report history of previous admission were statistically significant in the number of readmissions using the negative binomial model conclusion readmission to the psychiatric ward is mainly predictable by the type of diagnosis and psychosocial supports
Q aim the updated mean hba1c has been used in risk estimates of diabetic complications but it does not take into account the temporal relationship between hba1c and diabetic complications we studied whether the updated mean hba1c underestimated the risk of diabetic complications method continuous hba1c curves for 10 000 hypothetical diabetes patients were simulated over an average of 7 years simulations were based on hba1c values encountered in clinical practice we assumed that each short time interval of the continuous hba1c curves had a long lasting effect on diabetic complications as evidenced by earlier studies we tested several different hba1c variables including various profiles e g different duration of such a long lasting effect the predictive power of these variables was compared with that of the updated mean hba1c results the predictive power of the constructed hba1c variables differed considerably compared to that of the updated mean hba1c the risk increase per standard deviation could be almost 100 higher for a constructed predictor than the updated mean hba1c conclusions the importance of good glycemic control in preventing diabetic complications could have been underestimated in earlier hallmark studies by not taking the time dependent effect of hba1c into account

Q objective to examine the effect of exercise on overnight hypoglycemia in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus t1dm study design at 5 clinical sites 50 subjects with t1dm age 11 to 17 years were studied in a clinical research center on 2 separate days one day included an afternoon exercise session on a treadmill on both days frequently sampled blood glucose levels were measured at the direcnet central laboratory insulin doses were similar on both days results during exercise plasma glucose levels fell in almost all subjects 11 22 developed hypoglycemia mean glucose level from 10 pm to 6 am was lower on the exercise day than on the sedentary day 131 vs 154 mg dl p .003 hypoglycemia developed overnight more often on the exercise nights than on the sedentary nights p .009 occurring on the exercise night only in 13 26 on the sedentary night only in 3 6 on both nights in 11 22 and on neither night in 23 46 hypoglycemia was unusual on the sedentary night if the pre bedtime snack glucose level was gt 130 mg dl conclusions these findings indicate that overnight hypoglycemia after exercise is common in children with t1dm and support the importance of modifying diabetes management after afternoon exercise to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia

Q genetic redundancy poses a major problem to the analysis of gene function rna interference allows the down regulation of several genes simultaneously offering the possibility to overcome genetic redundancy something not easily achieved with traditional genetic approaches previously we have used a polycistronic mir155 based framework to knockdown expression of three genes of the early b cell factor family in cultured cells here we develop the system further by generating transgenic mice expressing the rnai construct in vivo in an inducible manner expression of the transgene from the strong cag promoter is compatible with a normal function of the basal mirna rnai machinery and the mir155 framework readily allows inducible expression from the rosa26 locus as shown by gfp however expression of the transgene in hematopoietic cells does not lead to changes in b cell development and neuronal expression does not affect cerebellar architecture as predicted from genetic deletion studies protein as well as mrna levels generated from ebf genes in hetero and homozygous animals are comparable to wild type levels a likely explanation for the discrepancy in the effectiveness of the rnai construct between cultured cells and transgenic animals lies in the efficiency of the sequences used possibly together with the complexity of the transgene since new approaches allow to overcome efficiency problems of rnai sequences the data lay the foundation for future work on the simultaneous knockdown of several genes in vivo

Q purpose preoperative axillary sonography with fine needle aspiration fna in patients with invasive breast cancer identifies patients with nodal metastasis who can be spared further surgery indiscriminate use of the diagnostic modality can increase costs and yield inaccurate results we evaluate the costs associated with the use of highly sensitive axillary ultrasonography in patients with stage 8805 t2 tumors patients and methods we constructed a decision analysis tree using treeage pro 2009 software comparing direct hospital charges between patients with and without routine use of axillary ultrasound base case estimates were derived from our institutional data and compared with those derived from the literature one and two way sensitivity analyses were performed to check the validity of our inferences results we found that for the base case estimate with 35 lymph node positivity in stage 8805 t2 tumors and sensitivity of the axillary ultrasound set at 86 with a specificity of 40 the strategy to perform preoperative axillary ultrasound yielded rollback costs of $15 215 compared with $15 940 for surgery plus sentinel lymph node biopsy cost difference $725 per patient favoring axillary ultrasound on two way sensitivity analysis the cost benefit for axillary ultrasound was not seen in patients with a low risk for nodal metastasis conclusion the adoption of routine preoperative axillary sonography with fna is a lower cost strategy than conventional strategies in patients with stage 8805 t2 invasive breast cancer
Q whisker deprivation weakens excitatory layer 4 l4 inputs to l2 3 pyramidal cells in rat primary somatosensory s1 cortex which is likely to contribute to whisker map plasticity this weakening has been proposed to represent long term depression ltd induced by sensory deprivation in vivo here we studied the synaptic expression mechanisms for deprivation induced weakening of l4 l2 3 inputs and assessed its similarity to ltd which is known to be expressed presynaptically at l4 l2 3 synapses whisker deprivation increased the paired pulse ratio at l4 l2 3 synapses and slowed the use dependent block of nmda receptor currents by mk 801 5s 10r 5 methyl 10 11 dihydro 5h dibenzo a d cyclohepten 5 10 imine maleate indicating that deprivation reduced transmitter release probability at these synapses in contrast deprivation did not alter either miniature epsc amplitude in l2 3 neurons or the amplitude of quantal l4 l2 3 synaptic responses measured in strontium indicating that postsynaptic responsiveness was unchanged in young postnatal day 12 p12 rats at least 4 d of deprivation were required to significantly weaken l4 l2 3 synapses similar weakening occurred when deprivation began at older ages p20 when synapses are mostly mature indicating that weakening is unlikely to represent a failure of synaptic maturation but instead represents a reduction in the strength of existing synapses thus whisker deprivation weakens l4 l2 3 synapses by decreasing presynaptic function similar to known ltd mechanisms at this synapse

Q the isomerization of the proline peptide bond between tyrosine 92 and proline 93 in bovine pancreatic ribonuclease a has been investigated in the unfolded protein as well as during the slow refolding process this bond is in the cis state in the native protein by comparison of various homologous ribonucleases we show that isomerization of proline 93 is associated with a change in fluorescence of tyrosine 92 this provides a spectroscopic probe to monitor this process in the disordered chain after unfolding as well as its reversal in the course of slow refolding in unfolded ribonuclease incorrect trans isomers of proline 93 are found in both slow folding species trans cis reversal of isomerization of this proline peptide bond during refolding shows kinetics that are identical with the time course of formation of native protein isomerization of proline 93 is slower than the formation of a native like folded intermediate that accumulates on the major slow refolding pathway models to explain these results are discussed
